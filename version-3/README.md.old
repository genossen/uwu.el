the [tamagotchi fandom
wiki](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)) has
improved markedly over the last few months, and now includes more
information about how the original tamagotchi game functions.

two things:

## 0 - release several simplified variations for Version 3

i may release version 3 as several different variations, to allow
people to experience the life-cycles of different pet species
discretely. the original tamagotchi had six different shell colours,
indicating six different species. this would not mean that there would
be growth/evolution, however. i may experiment with
networking/internet connectivity if this is the case, because it would
simplify the game significantly.

from the wiki:

- one baby variation
- one child variation
- two teen variations
- six adult variations
- one ‘special character’ that evolves from one particular adult variation.

how would networking function? i am not sure. i need to do some
exploration on that topic. if anyone has any suggestions, i am open to
listening (:

## 1 - adopt original tamagotchi timing for Version 3

i will probably adopt the ‘timing schedule’ of pet growth of the
original tamagotchi. from the [tamagotchi wiki](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)#Growth,_Care,_and_Lifespan):

> Five minutes after the clock is set, the Tamagotchi will be born,
> and will go through several stages of life. It begins with the Baby
> stage and evolves to the Child stage after 65 minutes. It will
> evolve into a teen at the age of 3, and into an adult by the age of
> 6.

this means:

- egg hatches after 5 mins
- baby turns into child after 65 mins
- child becomes teen after 3 days
- teen becomes adult after 6 days

so each stage lasts:

- egg (5 mins)
- baby (65 mins)
- child (3 days)
- teen (6 days)
- adult (dependent on user care for pet)
