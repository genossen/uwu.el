;;; Commentary:

;; This is a virtual pet for GNU Emacs. You can feed, clean, and play
;; with your pet. There are, in all, 10 different 'evolutions' of pet.

;; Looking after your pet well will make it live longer, and allow you
;; to evolve into a final 'secret' pet species.

;; This time around, the care that you put into looking after your pet
;; determines whether it becomes 'chaotic' or 'lawful'.
